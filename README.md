# SoftwareDesign_HW2
This semester we will be developing CourseApp, a “Facebook-killer” that aims to replace Facebook’s (and WhatsApp’s) monopoly on managing course groups. We will be developing the server-side functionality of the program, with the hope that clients will be written as projects

In this assignment refactor our project to use Monads and Future capabilites, adding messaging features (using the Observable Pattern).
